# Web Cache

## Intelligent caching

Web applications such as Salesforce have lots of Javascript and Cascading Style Sheets in order to provide a rich user experience that is comparable to what people experience with a desktop application. As a result, you’re going to have 3, 4 or 5MB javascript files that can take time to download, especially when you have packet loss. This one specific page with multiple plugins used by our Sales team has a total page size of 5 MB. Since it rarely changes, if you can enable caching on your network and create a cache derivative of it stored locally, you’ll be enabling larger file downloads and creating a much better experience for your users when loading Salesforce.

## Plugin usage

The average Salesforce customer has seven plugins within Salesforce, each of which can dramatically help or hurt the overall end-user experience of Salesforce. The majority of your total data transfer could actually be from these third-party plugins, which work with Salesforce to provide lead sourcing, marketing, sales and accounting capabilities. Therefore, you want to explore how much bandwidth your plugins are using, and from where these plugins are being served. The performance impact of these plugins should be a consideration when choosing between the available plugins, not just the features they have available. To gauge the full performance impact of these plugins, you need a tool that measures the full end-user experience with a real synthetic transaction, as that will allow you to see whether not only Salesforce is working properly but how your plugins are working as well.

These are the fundamental areas that you and your IT team can monitor to locate, avoid and resolve Salesforce performance issues. Even if you’re getting everything right with respect to how you’re running Salesforce, you need to make sure the entire underlying infrastructure is capable of delivering a quality Salesforce experience.
